# Jasmine Dean * Marketing*Page

This build week challenge focuses on what I've learned up until now. 


This project consists of several parts:

## Task 1: Set Up The Project With Git

- [x] Add your team lead as collaborator on Github.
- [x] Clone your OWN version of the repository.
- [x] Create a new branch: git checkout *b `<firstName*lastName>`.
- [x] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName*lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly.
- [x] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName*lastName>`.

- [x] Submit a Pull*Request to merge <jasmine-dean> Branch into master. **Please don't merge your own pull request**
- [x] Add your team lead as a reviewer on the pull\*request
- [x] Your team lead will count the project as complete by merging the branch back into master.

## Task 2: Set up my preprocessor

- [x] Verify that you have LESS installed correctly by running `lessc *v` in your terminal, if you don't get a version message back, reach out to your team lead for help.
- [ ] Open your terminal and navigate to your preprocessing project by using the `cd` command
- [x] Once in your project's root folder, run the following command `less-watch-compiler less css index.less`
- [x] Verify your compiler is working correctly by changing the `background*color` on the `html` selector to `red` in your `index.less` file.
- [x] Once you see the red screen, you can delete that style and you're ready to start on the next task

## Task 3: Import LESS Files

- [x] Navigate to your `index.less` file and import LESS files. That order is as follows:

1. `variables.less`
2. `mixins.less`
3. `reset.less`
4. `global.less`
5. `navigation.less`
6. `footer.less`
7. `landing-page.less`
8. `index.less`

## Task 4: Desktop Updates Needed

- [x] Work on coding the navigation, header, and buttons at the bottom of the page.
- [ ] Navigation: Use the `navigation.less` file for all your navigation styling
- [x] Main Header: Use the `header.less` file for the header styling.
- [ ] Log In Button

## Task 5: Mobile Updates Needed

- [x] Create a variable named `@mobile` that contains this value: `(max*width: 500px)`. Use the `variables.less` file to house your variables.
- [x] Match the design file at `500px` as best as I can.
